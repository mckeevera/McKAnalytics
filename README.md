This is a Repo for Alex McKeever's NFL Statistical Work

Files are roughly sorted by player position (wide receiver files are in WRs, kicker files in Kickers) though there are some exceptions
Each project should be within its own folder with a readme describing what the purpose of the file is

Over the summer (and hopefully during some free time during Spring Term) I will be working through two NFL analytics books

All data is taken from the NFLverse at this point in time

Graphics are typically posted with extra insight to: https://www.instagram.com/mckeever_analytics/

Shoutout to Ben Baldwin, Mina Kimes, Daniel Houston, and Jon Bois for essentially inspiring my career choice

Questions, comments, concerns, etc?
  Reach out to mckeevera@carleton.edu or alexmckeever25@gmail.com and I will try to get back to you quickly
