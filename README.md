# McK Analytics

This is a repository for Alex McKeever's Projects for McK Analytics

Files are organized by sport and then by project. Each project should be within its own folder with a readme describing what the purpose of the file is (readmes still in progress!)

All data is taken from the NFLverse at this point in time or public NFL season level data.

Graphics are typically posted with extra insight to: [https://www.instagram.com/mck_analytics/](https://www.instagram.com/mckeever_analytics/){.uri}

Shoutout to Ben Baldwin, Mina Kimes, Daniel Houston, and Jon Bois for inspiring my career choice and just being amazing people in the sports stats community.
